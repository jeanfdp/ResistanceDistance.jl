"""
    resistance_distance_matrix(g)

Calculate the resistance distance matrix for a graph.

# Arguments
- `g`: The graph for which the resistance distance matrix is to be calculated.

# Returns
- A matrix where the element at the i-th row and j-th column represents the resistance distance between nodes `i` and `j`. 

# Notes
- The resistance distance matrix is calculated using the formula for resistance distance in terms of the Laplacian matrix of the graph.
- The Laplacian matrix of the graph is calculated using the `laplacian_matrix` function.
- The pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is calculated using the `pinv` function from the LinearAlgebra module.

    resistance_distance(g, i::Int64, j::Int64)

Calculate the resistance distance between two nodes in a graph.

# Arguments
- `g`: The graph in which the resistance distance is to be calculated.
- `i`: The first node.
- `j`: The second node.

# Returns
- The resistance distance between nodes `i` and `j`.
